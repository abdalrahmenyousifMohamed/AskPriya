Submit Form I-765: The student needs to complete and submit Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This form can be found on the USCIS website.\\n\\n3. Gather Required Documents: The student should gather the necessary supporting documents, which may include a copy of their passport, Form I-20, I-94 record, and any other documents specified by the USCIS.\\n\\n4. Pay the Application Fee: The student must pay the required application fee when submitting Form I-765. The fee amount can be found on the USCIS website.\\n\\n5. Submit the Application: The student should submit the completed Form I-765, along with the supporting documents and application fee, to the USCIS. The application can be submitted online or by mail, as specified by the USCIS.\\n\\n6. Receive the Employment Authorization Document (EAD): If the OPT application is approved, the student will receive an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) from the USCIS. This document serves as proof of the student's employment authorization.\\n\\n7. Begin OPT Employment: Once the student receives the EAD, they can begin working in a job related to their field of study.
